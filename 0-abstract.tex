\chapter*{Abstract}
\par Conference presentation is a non-trivial task since it is affected by both presentation content and nonverbal behaviors. To improve presentation ability, we propose a training method based on imitating the famous past speech. Trainees imitate past famous speech by watching recorded videos, then the proposed system matches they trainees' and the orator's motion data and gives real-time visual feedback on how well they imitate the orators' speech. We employed the OpenPose Library to extract orators' motion data from past famous speech 2D video. During training, the system captures trainee's motion in real-time using the Kinect, then calculate the cosine similarity of adjacent limbs to get the similarity of the trainees' and orator's motion data.  
\par In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of our motion data matching algorithm and as well as the system effectiveness. We conducted two experiments to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and our proposed system. The first experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is able to match the traineeâ€™s motion and the orator's motion in the past famous speech. In our second experiment, we made a A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. According to the results, we can find that the trainee perform better after training using our proposed system. Notably, the trainees make more gestures and more suitable pauses during the presentation.
