\chapter{Proposed Presentation Training System}
\par In this paper, we propose a presentation training system that allow trainees to imitate past famous speech to improve their nonverbal behaviors. Firstly, we employed OpenPose library \cite{cao2017realtime} to extract orators' behaviors as motion data from past famous speech 2D video. Next, the system capture skeletal representations of the trainees' body in real-time using Microsoft Kinect. Then we calculate the cosine similarity of adjacent limbs as features to get the similarity of the trainees' motion and the motion of extracted famous orators.
